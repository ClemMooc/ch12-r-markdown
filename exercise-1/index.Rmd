  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # Your parameters should include a "query" and an "api_key"

  # Note: the HTTR library will take care of spaces in the arguments

   ## Try the interactive console:
   ## https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
   ## it will display the result in json format
   ## you can figure out how to extract the corresponding R list components

   ## From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article
   ## each in their own variables

# Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing your movie to your GetReview function
movie.info <- GetReview(movie)

   ## Return an list of the three pieces of information from above:
   ## return(list(summary, headline, link))

## get your API key.
## Mine is stored in the file "nyt_movie_reviews_api"
## you should not insert this in the code and upload to github.

### Store the name of the movie in a variable

### Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing the movie name variable to your GetReview function
