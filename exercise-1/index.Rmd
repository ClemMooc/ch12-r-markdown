### Exercise 1 ###

library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(httr)

### Write a function that allows you to specify a movie, then does the following:
GetReview <- function(movie) {
   ## movie: name of the movie
  
  # Construct a search query using YOUR api key
  # The base URL is https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?
  # Your parameters should include a "query" and an "api_key"
   ## Note: the HTTR library will take care of spaces in the arguments
   ## Use YOUR api key.  

   ## Try the interactive console:
   ## https://developer.nytimes.com/movie_reviews_v2.json#/Console/GET/reviews/search.json
   ## it will display the result in json format
   ## you can figure out how to extract the corresponding R list components
  
   ## Request data using your search query
  
  
   ## Flatten the data stored in the `$results` key of the data returned to you
  
   ## From the most recent review, store the headline, short summary, and link to full article
   ## each in their own variables

   ## Return an list of the three pieces of information from above:
   ## return(list(summary, headline, link))
  
}

## get your API key.
## Mine is stored in the file "nyt_movie_reviews_api"
## you should not insert this in the code and upload to github.
api.key <- readLines("~/Documents/keys/nyt_movie_reviews_api")

### Create a variable called `movie.info` by passing the name of your movie to your GetReview function
